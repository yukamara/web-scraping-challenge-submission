This was one of the most challenging assignments. It too me much longer but I am hppy with the end product. My final submission contains all files from the jupyter notebook to the css code. 

The submission instruction say to only include the jupyter notebook but I am not sure how the code could be test with just the notebook so I included everything.
I also included screenshots of the web app as well as the Flask code.

I got some help with the css code from the Flask documentation on how to place an reference the css file. I used this website: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/static/

My tutor was very helpful, I couldn't have gotten through this without her. She help direct me to a lot of very useful materials, shome of which I could not find with just a search.
